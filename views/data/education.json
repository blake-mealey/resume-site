		"description": "I am in the fourth year of my degree and I am enjoying it very much. Among the courses I have enjoyed and learned the most from so far in my degree are computing machinery, in which I made a snake game in assembly language, an introductory software engineering course which went into software development best practices, an introduction to graphics in which I wrote my own raytracer among other interesting projects, and an algorithms course which focused on implementations of data structures and algorithms. I have been on the Dean's List for the past three years."
