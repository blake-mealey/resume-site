		"description": "Worked in Java to build frameworks for GUI automation backends, using tools like SikuliX and Tesseract. This included working on PDF automation (parsing text from PDFs and using SikuliX visual tools on PDFs), and improving existing OCR functionality for desktop automation (mainly through image pre-processing using libraries like BoofCV). As part of the automation team I participated in daily standup emails and weekly team meetings where I shared what I worked on in the past week, any challenges I was facing with my projects, and what I would be working on in the coming week."
