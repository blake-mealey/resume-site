## Summary

I am in my third year at the University of Calgary pursuing a BSC in Computer Science. In my spare time I work on personal programming projects and look for chances to go hiking in the mountains.

As an experienced team member I have demonstrated problem solving skills and hard work in a variety of settings including programming competitions, programming clubs and construction labour work. My collaborators and supervisors recognize my focus on achieving the teamâ€™s goals and outcomes. I pursue a passion for programming in and out of the  class. While maintaining a high level of academic achievement, I also work independently on my own projects at home, ranging from game and web development to android applications and integrated systems. I put most of my new projects on GitHub.
